      p.main-text.card__description The mosquito repellent DEET was originally developed for the U.S. Army for use in the more insect-infested areas of the world. DEET works by simply blocking certain chemical receptors in the mosquito’s antennae, making it harder for them to “smell” humans.

      p.main-text.card__description The first attempt to build the Panama Canal was quite deadly, in most part due to tropical disease rather than accidents. Over 22,000 workers died or become hospitalized from mosquito-borne diseases like yellow fever or malaria. Only after stopping construction and embarking on an aggressive, years-long mosquito-eradication mission, was the canal finally completed.

      p.main-text.card__description One of the world’s biggest blood sucking mosquitos was spotted by a man in Argentina. How big? The terrifying <i>Psorophora ciliate</i> grows 20 times bigger than your average sized <i>Aedes albopictus</i> mosquitoes that spread chikungunya. And while they do have a nasty bite, luckily, they aren’t known to carry disease or parasites.
