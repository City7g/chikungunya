            <p class="main-text section__block-text">Chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread by Aedes mosquitoes. Since it was first identified in Tanzania in 1952, it has spread to the tropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Its name derives from the African Kimakonde language word “chikungunya”, which means “to become contorted”, and alludes to the painful appearance that those who contract it tend to take. Although deaths from chikungunya are rare, symptoms like severe joint pain and fatigue may be debilitating and last for years. </p>
            <p class="main-text--bold section__block-text">All it takes is one bite from an infected mosquito to contract chikungunya</p>

Symptoms of all three include fever, muscle pain, joint pain, rash, and headache.<br>Chikungunya disease tends to be associated with severe joint pain, but a true diagnosis can only be done by a blood test.<br>Malaria is transmitted by a different kind of mosquito, the Anopheles mosquito that primarily only bites at night. Rather than a virus, malaria is caused by a parasite. Malaria is associated with fever and chills or “flu-like” symptoms. </p>
